# Rancid Tomatillos - Mod 3 Paired Project

Rancid Tomatillos is a website that allows a user to select a movie poster and then view that particular movie's details. The user can then return to the main movie page via the "Go back" link or the back arrow on their browser to select a different movie to read about in detail.
